       <h2>Cinematographer</h2>
       <img src="cinematographer.jpg" align="right" width="300" length="100">
       <p class="About">The director of photography, or DP, is responsible for capturing the script on film or video. The DP must pay
            attention to lighting and the camera's technical capabilities.<br> When the director wants a shot to achieve certain visual or
            atmospheric qualities, the DP achieves it through his or her choice of lighting, film stock and careful manipulation of the
             camera. This craft is referred to as cinematography.</p><br>
        <h2>Editor</h2>
        <img src="Film editor.png" align="right" width="300" length="100">
        <p class="About">Shortly after shooting begins, the editor begins to organize the footage and arranges individual shots into one
             continuous sequence. Even in a single scene, dozens of different shots have to be chosen and assembled from hundreds of feet
              of film. The editor's choices about which shots to use, and the order in which to place them, have a profound effect on the
               appearance of the final film.</p> <br>
         <h2>Actors</h2> 
         <img src="actors.jpg" align="right" width="300" length="100">
         <p class="About">Responsible for portraying the characters in a film, actors work closely with the director and cinematographer.
              Considering an actor's role within this larger context also suggests that his or her job is much more difficult than just 
              appearing on the set and reciting lines.</p> <br>
          <h2>Music Supervisor</h2>       
          <img src="music.jpg" align="right" width="300" length="100">
          <p class="About">Music has been an integral part of movies since cinema's earliest days in the 1890s. A piano or organ player
               accompanied even the simplest silent films. The silent movie palaces of the 1920s were equipped with elaborate organs and
                orchestra pits to accommodate large groups of live musicians. Today selecting just the right music for the film will
                 intensify the story for the audience.</p> <br>
