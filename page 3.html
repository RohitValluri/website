       <h2>Production Designer</h2>

       <p class="About">Before one inch of film is shot, the production designer is the first artist to translate the script into visual
            form. He or she creates a series of storyboards that serve as the film's first draft.<br>A storyboard is a series of sketches
             on panels that shows the visual progression of the story from one scene to the next. Creating this sketch of the film on
              storyboards also ensures the visual continuity of the film from start to finish. Storyboards serve as the director's visual
               guide throughout the production and will be a template to follow during the editing process.</p><br>
        <h2>Art Director</h2>

        <p class="About">The art director is responsible for the film's settings: the buildings, landscapes and interiors that provide
             the physical context for the characters. This person is responsible for acquiring props, decorating sets and making the
              setting believable.</p><br>
        <h2>Costume Designer</h2>
        <img src="costume designers.jpg" align="right" alt="image" width="200" length="150">
        <p class="About">Costumes convey a great deal about the film's time period and the characters who wear them, including their
             economic status, occupation and attitude toward themselves. Be sure to think about how costuming can show something about
              the character visually.</p><br>
