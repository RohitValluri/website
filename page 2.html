       <h2>Producer</h2>
       <img src="producer.png" align="Right" alt=image width="200" length="150">
       <p class="About">This person is essentially the <strong>group leader</strong> and is responsible for managing the production from start to
            finish. The producer develops the project from the initial idea, makes sure the script is finalized, arranges the financing
             and manages the production team that makes the film.<br>The producer also coordinates the filmmaking process to ensure that 
             everyone involved in the project is working on schedule and on budget. Without the producer at the helm, films do not get
              made.</p><br>
        <h2>Director</h2> 
        <img src="diector1.jpg" align="right" alt=image width="200" length="100">
        <p class="About">The director is primarily responsible for overseeing the shooting and assembly of a film. While the director
             might be compared to a novel's author as a film's primary visionary, he or she would not be able to make the film without
             the help of numerous other artists and technicians.<br>In fact, the notion of the director as an author is misleading 
             because it assumes the director, like an author, does everything.   A director works at the center of film production, but is
              inextricably linked with dozens of other people who get the job done together.</p><br>
         <h2>Screenwriter</h2>  
         <img src="screenwriter.jpg" align=right alt=image width="200" length="100">
         <p class="About">While the dialogue in a film may seem natural to the viewer, a writer carefully crafts it; however, the
             screenwriter does far more than provide dialogue for the actors. He or she also shapes the sequence of events in a film to
             ensure that one scene transitions to the next so that the story will unfold logically and in an interesting way.<br>
             Like the producer, the screenwriter's role is generally overlooked by the movie-going public, yet is essential to the
              completion of any film. If there is no script, there is no movie.</p><br>
